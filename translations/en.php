By default, all countries are regrouped under large zones (e.g. Europe). If you want to set prices per country, you need to create custom zones and assign each country in a zone. We offer you the possibility to automatically create new zones based on the countries activated in the Shipping Manager. Keep in mind that by creating new zones, this will have an impact on ALL carriers. If you create unwanted zones, you will have to delete them manually. In order to allow shipping for a country outside Belgium, you will need to have the country included in a valid PrestaShop zone + specifically activate this country in a price zone within the Shipping Manager. Only PrestaShop prices will be used and displayed to your clients.';
